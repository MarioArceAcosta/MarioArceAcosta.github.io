Hello, nice to meet you! My name is Mario, and my academic background consists of a B.S. in Applied Mathematics/Economics and a Minor in Business Analytics. I am currently studying Statistics for a Master's in Science program at the University of California, Davis. I am proud to state that I presented my research at the Population Association of America 2025 Annual Conference, and that I will be presenting research at the 2025 Association for Public Policy Analysis & Management Conference!
