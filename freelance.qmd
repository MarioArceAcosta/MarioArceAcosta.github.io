Beyond college work and capstone projects (econometrics of Airbnb prices in Mexico using R; analysis of H-1B sponsor rates by industry type and location), I have also worked as a data analytics intern and as a research fellow (for which my research extended past the program). I have also taken courses in Coursera by IBM on data analysis (Python, Excel, AI), and have received certificates of completion.

In a year-long data analytics intern position, I learned how to create and implement a database into our center's initiative on analyzing academic technology usage. I reached out to technology vendors of the university, requesting data extracts and communicating with them on the interpretation of data. I streamlined data collection, and organized all data into a database that is still used at the center. I cleaned and prepared several spreadsheets with hundreds of thousands of rows within Google Sheets, and provided key metrics through dashboards and reports in Google Looker Studio. I connected this data and made it accessible through Slack. I reported on my progress through Slack, Asana, and Zoom meetings (disseminating findings through bi-weekly meetings). I implemented data governance policies and facilitated meetings on data governance. I wrote a document on data governance. I wrote, recorded, and hosted trainings for my colleagues in Looker Studio. Overall, I became an expert at Google Sheets, Looker Studio, and communicating data analyses through visualizations. Providing data-driven insights through story-telling.
